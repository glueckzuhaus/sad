Vinca Minor EN

Product information
In the Netherlands, the Vinca Minor does not originally occur in the wild, but it has become established in gardens and is visible in many places in our country. The plant is also known as Saw Palmetto and is extremely suitable as a ground cover because the offshoots spread underground. Even in heavily shaded areas a continuous green carpet is created, which gives unwanted weeds little chance. The garden plant will eventually be about 15 cm high and can be combined well with plants such as ferns and the Liriope.
Care
Originally the Vinca Minor, or the Lesser Saw Palmetto, comes from the Mediterranean area. The plant thrives there in sun and shade and prefers a somewhat moist soil. Its main flowering period lasts from February through May. However, if you plant Vinca Minor in a place with a little more sun, you will enjoy its flowers well into the summer! 
This plant is slightly poisonous.
Plant height
The Vinca Minor has a height of 25-40cm (measured with the pot).
This plant comes in a 17 cm in diameter/width.
