3x Pink Hydrangea macrophylla "farmers hydrangea"

Origin & product information
The most famous hydrangea is perhaps Hydrangea macrophylla, better known as the farmer's hydrangea. The farmer's hydrangea got its name because this hydrangea was often planted at farms. Hydrangea loves moisture, also one of the reasons why the plant was planted so often on the edge of farms; he drew moisture around the house. Hydrangeas are still blooming along ditches and water sides. The flowers appear between June and September. It is a very easy deciduous shrub that blooms in the late summer with modest to very theatrical colors. Its flowers are mostly spherical.

Care
In the case of the farmer's hydrangea, it is important to cut the faded flowers. But leave the old flowers alone during the winter months. They form a protection for the new flower buds against frost and inclement wind. In March, when the risk of frost has passed, all brown, old, faded flowers can be pruned back to just above the first or second healthy bud. In March prune back about 1/3 of the oldest, thickest branches to 5-10 cm above the ground. This form of pruning encourages the growth of new shoots and ensures that the flower size does not decrease.
All types of Hydrangeas absolutely do not like drought. Give them plenty of water in the event of drought, especially in spring and summer. It is not wise to give them a little water once in a while. It is best to give them a large amount of water in one go. Sometimes during the flowering season, hydrangeas become bald at the bottom. The leaves can also turn yellow. This is almost always caused by drought.
