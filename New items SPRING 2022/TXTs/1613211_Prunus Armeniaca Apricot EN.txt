Prunus Armeniaca 'Apricot' EN 
About the plant 
The name Prunus Armeniaca may make it seem like the plants are from Armenia, but they actually are from North-East Asia! The plant grows delicious sweet apricots that are slightly smaller than normal apricots. This makes them perfect for the moderate climate of North-West Europe. The deliciously sweet apricots can be harvested in August. The ripe apricots can be eaten right after harvest, but can also be used in jams. The apricot tree also has beautiful light pink flowers that blossom from march until early April. 
Care
The plant prefers a sheltered spot in the sun/semi shade facing the south. The more sun the plant gets, the better the fruits will grow. It prefers a well-drained soil. The plant can be pruned yearly in the winter. Crossing branches can be cut at this time. The Prunus Armeniaca will love fertiliser in early spring. 
Plant size 
The Prunus Armeniaca Apricot is delivered with a height of 100-120cm (measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 21cm.
