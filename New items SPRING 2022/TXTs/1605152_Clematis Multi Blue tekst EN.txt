Product information
Looking for something special for your garden? This large-flowered ''Clematis Multi Blue'' is perfect for you. The 'Clematis Multi Blue' produces beautiful violet-blue flowers which can grow up to 10 cm. The plant blooms twice a year and is a real eye-catcher in the garden. The first blooming period is around May-June and the second flowering is between July and September. With its large green leaves, the Clematis is also nice to look at outside the blooming season. It is the ideal plant to brighten up a gloomy corner of your garden. The clematis is a climber and can grow up against a fence or wall. This makes it perfect for a small city garden or a balcony.
Care
After the 'Clematis Multi Blue' has bloomed for the first time, it is best to prune, so that it can bloom again. After a few years this species will reach a height of about 2 to 3 metres. When you want to grow the clematis along a fence or rack, it is advisable to help the plant a bit. You can do this by tying the new shoots neatly along the rack or by guiding them through the fence. The clematis does very well in the semi-shade as well as in the sun. This makes it suitable for most places in the garden. With more sun, the clematis will bloom more abundantly. The roots of the clematis do need to be in the shade and cool. Make sure that there is always something covering the base of the plant or place the clematis deeper in the soil, about 10 cm deeper than the height of the root ball. This will protect it against the unpleasant wilting disease that can affect the above-ground stems; below ground the plant will remain healthy. The Clematis is very hardy and needs an average amount of water.
