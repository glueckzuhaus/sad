About the plant 

Pears from your own garden? It's possible with the Pyrus communis Conference! This tree grows delicious juicy pears that can be harvested from September until the end of November. When kept in a cool room, the harvested pears can be saved for a few months. It doesn't just produce delicious fruit, the tree brightens up your garden with its beautiful white blossom. The Pyrus communis is a self-pollinating tree, which means you don't need a second fruit tree to be able to grow fruit. 

Care 

To make sure the fruit grows as well as possible, make sure the fruit tree gets a sunny spot. The tree can be pruned after the blossoming and in the winter. At these times, the chances of damage are at their lowest. Halfway through the winter, the new branches can be shortened until around 20 centimetres. You will also do this with the main stem. After the winter pruning, new branches will appear. You can cut these away in the summer. 

Plant size 

The Pyrus communis Conference is delivered with a height of 100-120cm (measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 21cm.
