Set of 2 extra large, wonderfully scented Tuscan Jasmine plants on a stick - 120cm high!

This jasmine plant has its Latin name "Trachelospermum Jasminoïdes" but is better known in the Netherlands as star jasmine or Tuscan jasmine.
It is a fantastic evergreen climbing plant with many good qualities.
For example, the plant has beautiful dark green leaves all year round, which sometimes take on a red, bronze-like color in winter.
But the best thing about this plant are of course the wonderfully scented white flowers.
From spring onwards, this plant produces white, star-shaped flowers that give off a wonderful scent.
The plant flowers from May to September and is also hardy to -10 degrees Celsius and evergreen.
In addition to being used as a climbing plant, the jasmine can also be used as a flowering ground cover.

Grooming
The Tuscan Jasmine is a real climbing plant. The young plants need some support in the beginning when climbing.
The plant prefers a position in full sun or partial shade and well-drained soil.
In severe frost, it is wise to cover the base of the plant with, for example, non-woven cloth.

Plant height
The plants are delivered with a total height of approximately 110-120 cm (measured incl. Pot)
The Jasmine have grown up on sticks so that they are immediately very high upon arrival.
