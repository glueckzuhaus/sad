Lonicera Henryi & Lonicera Serotina
Product information
This set of two honeysuckles is perfect for any garden. These climbing plants are ideal for growing along fences or walls. Lonicera 'Serotina' has remarkable multicoloured flowers. The plant blooms in the summer months with white-dark pink flowers. The white part of the flowers fades to yellow. After blooming, this Lonicera forms several bright red berries. Honeysuckles bloom from May to August.
Care
To get the plants to climb, it is best to help them a little and let them grow along a rack. The honeysuckle is easy to take care of and can be placed in most places. The roots like shade, but the tendrils like sunlight. It will also grow well in the shade or half-shadow, but it will not flower as abundantly. Make sure you prune your Lonicera regularly to keep it fresh and compact. If you choose not to prune, the plants will grow about 4 metres tall. Prune the plants in mid-March by cutting back branches that are too long and old. You will be rewarded with many young branches and an abundance of flowers. After the blooming period it is also possible to cut back very long branches, so that the plants look neater. Loniceras are enormously popular with butterflies and moths, such as the Silver Y and the Hummingbird hawk-moth. Bees also love these wonderfully smelling climbers. It is a great addition to the wildlife in your garden!
The Lonicera Serotina will be delivered with a height of approximately 25-40 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 9 cm.
