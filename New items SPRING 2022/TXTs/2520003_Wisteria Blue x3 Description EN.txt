Set of 3 Wisteria - Wisteria plants

Product information
The Blue Rain, better known as the Wisteria, is an exuberant flowering vine that is used on pergolas or against walls or fences. The plant originates in the United States, China and Japan.
It is a fast growing climbing plant with beautiful blue flowers that hang down. The long flower clusters have a lovely fragrance and can grow up to 25 cm long. It is a beautiful climbing plant with twigs swinging all around. Especially in the beginning they need some support, because the branches do not have adhesive roots. A full grown Wisteria represents quite a bit of weight. A solidly constructed pergola is therefore very useful. It is important to route the twigs so that they cannot damage downspouts or gutters. The wisteria is very powerful and can damage it. "Leaf corridors or" berceaus "are often formed with the help of wisteria. It is truly a fantastic experience to walk through such a flowering canopy.

Care
The Wisteria is not a difficult plant, but it must be guided along the wall or against a pergola. The plant likes a lot of sun and a moderate to moist soil. The plant is very hardy and must be pruned 1-2 times a year. In late summer, around July / August, the side branches of the wisteria have become gigantic. The plant can climb to a height of 10 meters just like that. Then cut the long side branches back to about 40-50 centimeters. This way he gets through the winter well. In early spring, around January / February, cut the side shoots back to about 10-15 inches. Always prune it in frost-free weather. From there it will bloom again. To encourage flowering, cut the side shoots at 2-3 buds from the main stem branch. This induces the formation of flower spores.

Plant height
The plants are delivered with a total height of 30-40cm
