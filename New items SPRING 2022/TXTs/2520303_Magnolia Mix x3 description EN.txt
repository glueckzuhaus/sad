Care

The mix contains the following 3 types:

The Magnolia 'soulangeana' is a very popular ornamental shrub with a beautiful bloom. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 m high and is therefore a good filler in a large garden. The Magnolia 'soulangeana' flowers on the bare, dark brown branches in the month of April. Large, fragrant, tulip-shaped flowers appear that have a lilac-pink color with a white interior. The plant may get a second bloom in the summer months. The large, oblong, dark green leaves appear during or after flowering. The plant is very hardy. For abundant flowering it is important that the Magnolia 'soulangeana' gets a sunny position in a rich, acid soil. A jewel for the garden!

The Magnolia 'Susan' usually blooms in April with dark pink, banana-shaped flowers. Some flowers open more in a kind of fan shape. The Magnolia 'Susan' has oval leaves that become visible after flowering. The Magnolia 'Susan' can grow into a full-fledged tree but is easy to prune. Use garden plant soil when planting for food.

The Magnolia stellata is a deciduous, broad-growing shrub / small tree that can reach a height of 3 to 4 m. The plant has a beautiful bloom! In the month of April, large, fragrant, tulip-like flowers appear of a pure white color. The firm, medium green leaves appear after flowering. This falls off in the fall. The Magnolia stellata is completely hardy, but still requires a sheltered location because of the freezing of flower buds. You can also cover in winter. Preferably plant the Magnolia stellata in partial shade.
