About the plant
Bring the ultimate spring vibe into your garden with the Magnolia Soulangeana. The Magnolia is the eye-catcher in every garden. The Magnolia is a very popular ornamental shrub that blossoms beautifully. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters high and is therefore a good filler in any large garden. Magnolia 'Soulangeana' blooms on its bare, dark brown branches in April. Large, fragrant, tulip-shaped flowers appear with a lilac-pink colour with a white inside. The plant may have a second bloom in the summer months. The large, oblong, dark green leaves appear during or after flowering. 
Care
To be sure that the Magnolia blossoms abundantly, it is important that it is given a sunny spot in a rich, acidic soil. Magnolias don't need to be pruned, they actually grow the most beautifully without being pruned. If you do wish to prune the Magnolia, it is best to keep it to a minimum. In winter, the flower buds need protection from freezing temperatures. The plant is not toxic. 
Plant size 
The Magnolia Soulangeana will be delivered with a height of 30 to 40cm (this is always measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 17cm.
