Care
Humulus lupulus 'Nordbrau' is a vine, and it does need a steady support to climb. If you want to keep your hop plant compact, it is best to let it grow 3 to 5 branches in spring and prune everything to the ground in autumn. Hop is a member of the perennial family, which means that the leaves die off in the winter and the plant starts to sprout again in the spring. It is very hardy; the roots hibernate under the ground. Put the Humulus preferably in the sun. Water the plant regularly and keep the soil a little moist. This way you will get to enjoy the Humulus lupulus 'Nordbrau' even more.
The Humulus lupulus 'Nordbrau' wordt geleverd met een hoogte van 60-70 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 15 cm.
