Care
Prune the clematis at the end of the winter back to 30 cm above the ground, this way you get the most beautiful flowers and keep the plant in good shape. When you want to grow the clematis along a fence or rack, it is advisable to help the plant a bit. You can do this by tying the new shoots neatly along the rack or by guiding them through the fence. The clematis does very well in the semi-shade as well as in the sun. This makes it suitable for most places in the garden. With more sun, the clematis will bloom more abundantly. The roots of the clematis do need to be in the shade and cool. Make sure that there is always something covering the base of the plant or place the clematis deeper in the soil, about 10 cm deeper than the height of the root ball. This will protect it against the unpleasant wilting disease that can affect the above-ground stems; below ground the plant will remain healthy. The Clematis is very hardy and needs an average amount of water.
