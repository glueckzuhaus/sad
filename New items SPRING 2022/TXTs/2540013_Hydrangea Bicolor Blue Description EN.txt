Care
It is important for the Hydrangeas to cut off the dead flowers. But leave the old flowers alone during the winter months. They protect the new flower buds from frost and harsh wind. In March, when the danger of frost has passed, all brown, old, dead flowers can be pruned back to just above the first or second healthy bud. In March, cut back about 1/3 of the oldest, thickest branches to 5-10 cm above the ground. This form of pruning encourages the growth of new shoots and ensures that the flower size does not decrease.
All types of Hydrangeas do not like drought at all. During drought, especially in spring and summer, water them well. It is not wise to give them a little water now and then. It is best to give them a large amount of water in one go. Hydrangeas sometimes become a bit bare at the bottom during the flowering season. The leaves can also turn yellow. This is almost always caused by drought.
