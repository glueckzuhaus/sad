Carex hachijoensis Evergold
Product information
'Carex Evergold' is an evergreen ornamental grass. This means that the plant retains its leaves in winter. This is the reason that the Carex has been one of the most popular ornamental grasses for years. The plant does well as a border planting, in a border or in a decorative pot. 'Carex Evergold' flowers with cheerful spikes in spring and grows to a height of 40 cm. This plant has little tendency to proliferate. and combines well with other plants.
Care
The Carex likes a spot in semi shade with a humus-rich soil and not too many tree roots in the surrounding area. A dry soil will not be a problem for this ornamental grass. Direct sunlight can damage the leaves, so put the Carex in the shade rather than in the sun. We advise you to give this evergreen Carex a trim occasionally during spring. You can do this by cutting away the browned gras to 10 cm above the ground. Pruning is not a requirement, but you will prevent older grass from developing brown spots. After pruning, this plant will sprout again, and the Carex will be even more beautiful than before!
The Carex Evergold will be delivered with a height of 25-35 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 14 cm.
