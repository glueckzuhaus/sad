Prunus Domestica Opal EN 
About the plant 
The Prunus domestica Opal is one of the most well-known types of plum. The tree is self-pollinating, which means you don't need a second fruit tree to grow fruit. The plums have a true taste explosion and a thin skin. They are perfect to eat right from the tree, but they can also be used in jams and juices. The delicious plums can be harvested in July/August. After the harvest the plums have a shelf life of about three weeks. In April/May the tree has beautiful, slightly fragrant white flowers. 
Care
The Prunus domestica Opal is not hard to care for. The tree prefers a spot in the sun, but can also be put in the semi shade in a nutritious, calcareous soil that is not too wet. The more sun the plant receives, the better the fruit will grow. The plumtree loves to be fertilised in spring, as an extra boost for the summer. The plumtree can be pruned after harvest. 
Plant size 
The Prunus domestica Opal is delivered with a height of 100-120cm (measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 21cm.
