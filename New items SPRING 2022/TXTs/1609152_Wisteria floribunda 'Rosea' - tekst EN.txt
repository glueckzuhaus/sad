Wisteria floribunda 'Rosea'
Product information
Wisteria floribunda Rosea', also known as Japanese wisteria, is a pink-flowered decorative plant. This variety grows and blooms in the same way as the original Blue Japanese Wisteria, but it is slightly more exclusive! It is a climbing plant with beautiful, very long, pink flower clusters that appear abundantly in May and June. There might also occur an additional blooming period in September. It is a fast-growing climber that can reach a maximum height of 10 metres. The flowers have a characteristic scent similar to that of grapes. Be patient with this beautiful climbing plant; it can take a few years before the pink flowers will bloom properly.
Care
To maintain the shape of the wisteria, you can grow it along a pergola, a fence or a rack. Make sure there is a solid support, to which the branches are attached so that it can climb towards the sun. It is also important to prune the plant regularly during its growth or in early spring. Prune preferably twice a year. In early spring, cut away all superfluous branches. The remaining branches will later produce flowers. In the summer, when the plant is growing vigorously, it is best to guide the long shoots in the direction you want. When you don't use these shoots, it's best to remove them. If you keep your Wisteria compact and give it a sunny spot, it will bloom even more abundantly with wonderfully fragrant flower clusters in spring. With good care, the Japanese wisteria can live up to hundreds of years. Older stems take on a decorative, twisted shape.
The Wisteria Rosea will be delivered with a height of approximately 60-70 cm (measured including the pot). The pot has a width of 15 cm.
