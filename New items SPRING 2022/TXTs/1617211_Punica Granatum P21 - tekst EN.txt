Punica granatum Early
Product information
Punica Granatum Early' is a pomegranate tree that grows from a shrub into a small tree with a round crown. The pomegranate is one of the oldest cultivated fruit trees. It is native to areas from south-eastern Europe to western Asia and the western Himalayas. The leaves are shiny and the branches have thorns. The shiny green leaves turn brownish yellow in the autumn. In June and July it blooms with striking orange-red flowers. After blooming, around August and September, red, edible fruits appear. These fruits have inspired countless references in literature and art, and the fruit of the pomegranate has long been regarded as a symbol of beauty and fertility. Only the seeds of the fruit are edible. The seeds are juicy and full of vitamins. When a ripe fruit falls on the ground and opens, the seeds burst out in all directions, hence the name pomegranate. 
Care
The Punica Granatum is not difficult to take care of, but in our climate it needs a warm summer to ripen. In summer it likes to stand in a sheltered and sunny place. In winter it is wise to bring this plant inside because of its limited hardiness. In full soil the pomegranate can withstand dry conditions. In a pot, it will need to be watered regularly during the growing period. The pomegranate is a relatively easy plant to maintain, but because of its bushy shape it may need pruning to grow into a standard tree.  After blooming, prune the offshoots at the bottom of the tree. Pruning helps to shape the structure of the tree.
The Punica Granatum will be delivered with a height of 70-80 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 21 cm.
