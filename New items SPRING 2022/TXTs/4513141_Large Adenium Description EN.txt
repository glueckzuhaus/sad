Large Adenium Desert Rose

The Adenium, better known as the desert rose, is a very beautiful plant. As the name suggests, it comes from the arid parts of the desert of East and Northeast Africa.
Locally, the Adenium can grow up to 5 meters high with a beautiful bare trunk full of character. Fortunately, it does not grow nearly that big at home and it gets fresh green leaves. Striking about the Adenium are the beautiful pink flowers and the irregular shapes of the trunk.

Care
Due to the fact that it is a desert rose, the Adenium needs a lot of sunlight. He prefers to be in a spot on the south. Watering too much is by far the most important reason that these houseplants do not survive in the living room culture.
It is often best to wait before watering until the soil is nearly dry. In the summer you can give a little more, because then the desert rose will grow better. In winter and when the plant is cold, it is best to water very sparingly, because then the chance is much greater that wet roots will rot.

If it is in a place with no or too little sun, it will not flower. And that is a shame because of its large amount of beautiful flowers! It blooms until the end of July and the second bloom is in September and October. If the Adenium grows too large, you can partially prune it back, this is best done when it has finished flowering. If the plant develops side shoots, it is best to prune them off. In this way, the plant can only focus its energy on flowering at the top.

For that reason, it is also best to give lukewarm water.
