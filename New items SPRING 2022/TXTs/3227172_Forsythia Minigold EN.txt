About the plant 
Spring becomes one big party with the Forsythia Minigold. This plant has beautiful golden yellow flowers that are fully in blossom in early spring and can't be missed! They have a beautiful yellow colour that brings summer vibes to the early spring days! The Forsythia Minigold is a shrub that can be kept very compact, which makes it perfect for bigger as well as smaller gardens. They can grow up to 1,2 meters high. 
Care
The Forsythia prefers a sunny or semi shade spot with humus rich soil. The plant will develop new shoots in summer. These will give new flowers in the following spring. This plant is not toxic. They can be pruned back every year after blossoming and branches can be cut off at the end of the winter. These can blossom beautifully in a vase. After the plant blossoms, the deep green leaves appear and from this moment the plant needs less care. 
Plant size 
The Forsythia Minigold is delivered with a height of 25 to 40cm. The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 17cm.
