Campsis Indian Summer
Product information
Campsis Indian Summer has beautiful orange trumpet-shaped flowers and adds a Mediterranean touch to your garden. The Campsis is also known as the trumpet vine. The plant grows upwards with the help of aerial roots. These roots allow the plant to climb along a wall or fence. Therefore, the trumpet vine is also very suitable for a smaller city garden. This fast-growing climber originates from America, but you can also find this plant in Italy, Spain, Greece, and Croatia. Fortunately, the Campsis is quite hardy, so you can easily bring the exotic feeling into your garden.
Care
Place the plant in a sunny and somewhat sheltered spot. With plenty of sun, this trumpet flower will bloom more abundantly and for longer. The Campsis blooms relatively late in the summer. When most plants have finished flowering, the trumpet climber is a colourful addition to the garden. The plant does not need much water, but make sure it gets plenty of water in case of heat or drought, especially the first year. 'Campsis Indian Summer' grows more compactly than other species. You can prune it into the desired shape in early spring. Don't be afraid to prune it back when it gets too big and bushy. It is a strong and fast-growing plant that will not be affected by pruning. 
The Campsis Indian Summer will be delivered with a height of approximately 60-70 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 15 cm.
