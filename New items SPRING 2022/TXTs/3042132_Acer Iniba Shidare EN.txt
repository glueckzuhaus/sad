Acer Iniba Shidare EN
About the plant
The Japanese maple Iniba Shidare is a striking Japanese maple. Its origins lie in Japan and Korea. It has a beautiful wine red colour that transforms into deep red to orange-red in Autumn. They are shaped like a mushroom as they grow wide rather than high. They can reach a width of up to 4 meters! This Japanese maple brings a colour explosion to your garden and grows beautiful purple-red clusters of little flowers from April to May. 
Care
The Iniba Shidare is easy to care for. The plant is happy in a semi-shaded spot in well-drained soil. When the Japanese maple receives enough water in summer, the Autumn colours will be more intense. They don't have to be pruned, but if it is necessary the best time to do this is in late Autumn, as they go into their rest period. The Iniba Shidare is hardy, but deciduous. 
Plant size 
The Iniba Shidare is delivered with a height of 30-40cm (this is measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a 13cm diameter.
