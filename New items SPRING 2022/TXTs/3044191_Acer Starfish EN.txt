Acer Starfish EN
About the plant
The reason this Japanese maple is called Starfish, becomes clear as soon as you see the shape of its leaves. The deep cuts give them a starlike shape and the downward facing curls makes them look just like starfish! But the Starfish shaped leaves are not the only striking part about this extraordinary maple. The leaves have the most beautiful deep red colour, which becomes even deeper in Autumn. The tree grows upwards and widens on the top, which gives the plant a beautiful vase like shape. The Starfish maple is hardy and deciduous. 

Care
The plant favours a semi shady to sunny spot. It can be planted in the ground as well as in a pot, which means it is perfect for gardens of all sizes. When planted in the ground, they prefer a moist, acidic soil. When planted in a pot, universal soil can be used. The plant can be pruned in summer or in December, but only when necessary.  

Plantsize 
The Acer Starfish is delivered with a height of 50 to 60cm (this is measured including the pot). The plant is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 19cm.
