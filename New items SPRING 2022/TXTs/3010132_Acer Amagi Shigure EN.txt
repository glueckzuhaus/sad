Acer Amagi Shigure EN 

About the plant
The Japanese maple Amagi Shipure is one of the most exciting discoveries from Japan: a striking and colourful maple that undergoes a true transformation during every season! In spring, this maple has gorgeous pink-purple leaves, which slowly start to turn red as time goes on. In Autumn they have a deep red orange colour, which brings a true colour explosion to your Autumn garden! The maple is a real eye-catcher that steals the show in Spring as well as Autumn. Japanese maples are slow growers and can grow up to 1,5 meters high. Because they are slow growers, they are also very well suited for smaller gardens and balconies. 
Care 
The Japanese maple prefers a spot in semi shade. The plant is hardy and can be planted all year round. They can be planted in the ground, as well as in a pot, as long as it is not in the hot afternoon sun. The Japanese maple does not like to be in dry soil and needs some extra water in dry periods. They are hardy, but they are deciduous. 
Plant size 
The plant will be delivered with a height of 30-40cm (this is measured including the pot). The Amagi Shipure is delivered in a pot with a diameter of 13cm.
