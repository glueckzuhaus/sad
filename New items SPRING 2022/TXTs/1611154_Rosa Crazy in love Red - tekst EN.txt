Care
The rose starts to bloom in June and will continue to bloom until October or November. To stimulate blooming it is advisable to remove old flowers. The climbers like a sunny spot and for the best growth you should cut it back to about 30 centimetres above the ground every other year. This way you prevent the rose from growing bare underneath. The best time for this is in the autumn or early spring. The rose needs some help in climbing. This can be done by guiding the branches along a rack, post or fence. Roses are known to use a lot of nutrition. To keep the climbing rose healthy we advise you to feed it annually with artificial fertilizer suitable for roses.
The red Rosa Crazy in Love will be delivered with a height of 60-70 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 15 cm.
