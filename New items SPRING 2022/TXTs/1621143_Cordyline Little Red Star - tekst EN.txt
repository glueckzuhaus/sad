Cordyline Little Red Star

Cordyline Little Red Star, also known as the Red Grass Tree, is a real eye-catcher for your garden. Red cabbage palms are originally only found in New Zealand, in woodland, riverbanks and swampy areas. The name Cordyline comes from the Greek word kordyle, meaning "club," a reference to the enlarged underground stems or rhizomes. The name 'Red Star' stems from the purple-red, spiky leaves. The palm is striking, graceful and slow growing. This makes it suitable for smaller gardens. Cordylines are known as easy, stable plants that are drought and heat resistant. It is the perfect plant for a pot on a balcony or terrace, but also does very well in soil.
Care
Place the Little Red Star in direct sunlight or semi shade, in a fertile, well-drained soil. Generally, palms do not require much maintenance and once fully grown they require little water. Give the palm plenty of water in the first summer. If the plant is growing in a pot, regular watering and feeding is recommended. In winter, they usually need to be protected. In case of frost, bring them inside or cover them. Pruning is not necessary; the cabbage palm will naturally lose its old leaves. However, the leaves can be removed to improve the appearance of the plant.
The Cordyline Little Red Star will be delivered with a height of approximately 30-40 cm (measured including pot). The pot has a width of 14 cm.
