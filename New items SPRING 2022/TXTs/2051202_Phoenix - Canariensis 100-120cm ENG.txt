Phoenix - Canariensis 100-120cm

Origin & product information
The Phoenix Canariensis originates from the Canary Islands. There are many different species of the Phoenix, of which the Canariensis is the best known and most common. You can find the Phoenix Canariensis in every tropical climate nowadays, but in Spain and Italy these palms are often used as plant material along public roads or are planted as ornamental plants. In a tropical climate, this palm can grow up to 18 meters high with leaves of 5 to 6 meters long. This palm is moderately hardy and can have a maximum of 5 degrees of frost.

Care
This palm loves a sunny location (full sun is no problem) and a very well-drained soil. Water every day during a dry spring and / or warm, dry summers. Ensure that the palm is always in well-drained soil and that excess water can be drained directly from the pot. We recommend fertilizing the palm once a year with concentrated or liquid plant food. The Phoenix Canariensis is a strong rooter and can be planted in the ground or in a pot. With a decorative pot, make sure that the plant gets enough space.

Plant height
The plants are supplied with a height of approximately 100-120 cm (measured incl. Pot)
